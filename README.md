# Etch-A-Sketch

This prototype works for all vlaues (1 - 100)

it prompts the user for a number ✅
it creates a grid of boxes with the number✅
when the grid boxes are hovered over it changes the colour to pink✅
Made it so the programme dynamically makes divs for each column and that column holds the same number (grid number) of blocks.



Ways to make better:
consider removing the ".grid" class and adding the event listener to the divs directly in the loops they are created in.
