# Etch-A-Sketch

This prototype currently only works for the value of 16

it prompts the user for a number ✅
if the number is 16 it makes the gird 16x16 boxes ✅
when the grid boxes are hovered over it changeds the colour ✅
however, due to the current CSS specifications is only able to make a perefect grid of 16x16 ❌

To do:
I plan to make a function that dynamically makes divs for each row and that holds the grid number of blocks.

Ways to make better:
consider removing the ".grid" class and adding the event listener to the divs directly in the loops they are created in.
